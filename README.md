# Geographical tiling
This is work in progress towards developing tiled or 'woven' geospatial data layers for possible symbolisation of complex multiattribute choropleths.

The working document is [`testing Tiling code.ipynb`](testing Tiling code.ipynb).

The needed modules are given in the conda `tiling.yml` file.

This has been forked from [https://github.com/fogleman/Tiling](Tiling) and the original README contents of that package can be found [here](Tiling-README.md).
